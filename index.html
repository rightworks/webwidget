            <li>Matthew‬ ‭7:1 - 2‬
                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be
                        judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.&#34;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Matthew‬ ‭7:12‬
                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law
                        and the Prophets.&#34;
                    </li>

            <li>‭‭John‬ ‭15:10 - 12‬
                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s
                        commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your
                        joy may be complete. My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.&#34;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.&#34;</li>

            <li>Galatians‬ ‭5:14
                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: &#34;Love your neighbor as
                        yourself.&#34;&#34;
                    </li>

            <li>1 Corinthians‬ ‭13:4 - 7‬
                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It
                        does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record
                        of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always
                        trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.&#34;

            <li>1 John‬ ‭3:21 - 23‬
                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive
                        from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him. And this is his
                        command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he
                        commanded us.&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for
                        you are all one in Christ Jesus.&#34;
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing
                        that counts is faith expressing itself through love.&#34;
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts
                        through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.&#34;

                    <li>&#34;&#34;You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell
                        you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,&#34;
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;&#34;Have faith in God,&#34; Jesus answered. &#34;Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this
                        mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that
                        what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for
                        in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying,
                        if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you
                        your sins.&#34;&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they
                        will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever
                        you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. You may ask me for anything
                        in my name, and I will do it.&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his
                        will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we
                        asked of him.&#34;

                        for you.&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding
                        fault, and it will be given to you. But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because
                        the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it
                        will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am
                        I with them.&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;&#34;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those
                        who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
                        Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are
                        the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see
                        God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who
                        are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&#34;

                <ul>
                    <li>&#34;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so
                        that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh
                        and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark
                        world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full
                        armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and
                        after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around
                        your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the
                        readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of
                        faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of
                        salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all
                        occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on
                        praying for all the Lord’s people.&#34;
